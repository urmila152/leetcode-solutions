### 📜 Problem Description

Given an integer array  `nums`  where the elements are sorted in  **ascending order** , convert  *it to a*  ***height-balanced***   *binary search tree* .

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: [0,-10,5,null,-3,null,9] is also accepted:

```

**Example 2:**

 ![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/18/btree.jpg) 

```
Input: nums = [1,3]
Output: [3,1]
Explanation: [1,null,3] and [3,1] are both height-balanced BSTs.

```

**Constraints:**

	
- `1 <= nums.length <= 104`
	
- `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
	
- `nums`  is sorted in a  **strictly increasing**  order.
